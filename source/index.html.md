### 2. Send a question to Hut34 and get a response

Sending your question to Hut34 and getting response is simple. To send your question you need to post json to your Hut34. You can use following Payload class.

<div class="center-column"></div>
```javascript
    public class Payload {
      public string message { get; set; }
    }
```






You will need to post your json to following url by replacing [DEVICE_KEY] with the key that you get from previous step.

`https://platform.hut34.io/botquery?platform=msft&key=[DEVICE_KEY]`

Here is the the complete code in C#:

<div class="center-column"></div>
```c#
var client = new WebClient();
        client.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.ContentType] = "application/json";
        var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(new Payload { message = "what is day today." });
        string response = client.UploadString("https://platform.hut34.io/botquery?platform=msft&key=[Device_Key]", json);
```

Your query will be processed by hut34 platform. Hut34 response will be sent back to you in following json format. 


<div class="center-column"></div>
```json
    {
        {
        "id": "b224cad-7337-448b-82dd-5ce6d77a755",
        "timestamp": "17-11-2017 11:35:42",
        "message": "response from hut34",
        "response": {
            "source": "source of response",
            "resolvedQuery": "original query",
            "isComplete": true
        },
        "input": {
            "source": "calling bot",
            "Key": "35686e7518v74dabnvbbd9224acd8d"
